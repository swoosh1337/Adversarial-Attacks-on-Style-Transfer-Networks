# Adversarial Attacks on Neural Style Transfer
This repository contains the paper "Adversarial Attacks on Neural Style Transfer," which investigates the vulnerability of three state-of-the-art neural style transfer algorithms (Neural Neighbor Style Transfer (NNST), AdaIN Style Transfer, and Fast Style Transfer) to various adversarial attacks. The objective is to understand the weaknesses of these networks, compare the results of different attacks, and explore methods for improving the reliability and robustness of the neural style transfer algorithms.
